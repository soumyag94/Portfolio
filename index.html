        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an Indian who was raised in Indonesia but am currently living in Canada. I did my BA in Political Science and Economics from UBC Vancouver. Right after, I landed a job as an Assistant to a Communication Director. It took me two years to decide that the stereotypical admin position job is just not for me. In other words; I am a third-culture kid who is just looking for a platform to extend her experiences for the betterment of the world. </p>

        <h3>How did I start web-developing you ask?</h3>

        <p> I was looking for something new, but more importantly, something thrilling. I was always fascinated by coding. For the longest time, however;  I thought I would have to devote years and years to CS to learn it all. As any 20-something year-old millennial would say, “the struggle is real”. I soon, however; came to worship the internet. I stumbled upon some youtube V-logs of individuals who were once exactly on the same boat as I was. I researched and learnt more and more about the CS world and finally stopped looking for the platform I needed. I knew for certain I was ready to learn and make a change for the better. Also let me tell you something else, this is one of the most welcoming communities yet! </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to start by mastering the basic CS languages, and work my way up. I want to get smarter and quicker with coding until I have learnt EVERYTHING there is to know about it, (shoot for the moon and land on the stars, am I right?). My immediate goal is to establish a good portfolio, with diverse projects. In order to do so, I am currently working on gaining the skills. </p>
        <p>Some of the languages I am currently focused on learning are listed as follows:
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With time, I want to share my knowledge and encourage others out there to pick up coding. More importantly, as a woman of colour, I hope to one day give confidence to young girls out in the world, to learn Computer Science, and not be intimidated by the male dominance in this field of work!</p>
